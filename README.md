# About Merman 
There still exists airlines today that rely on paper and pen logbooks on flights to track and manage cabin defects that require servicing. Merman is an integrated 3-way platform to display and manage cabin defects easily. <br/><br/>
We believe that reporting cabin defects starts with not only the cabin crew, but passengers too. <br/>
Tracking and managing the statuses of various defects is made easy for engineers through this platform.
